Application to simulate low energy neutrons.

						DETECTOR & PARTICLE INJECTION CONFIGURATION
===================================================================
Two DetectorList are provided:

1. DetectorList_ground.xml

Intended to simulate only ground of dimensions given
in the file. Thickness corresponds to the variable groundSizeZ 

Default values are 5x5x1 m3

The ground default material is Standard Rock
but can be changed in G4NeutronDetectorConstruction::CreateGround().
The material should be in G4Models/Materials.{cc,h}

Particles (neutrons) are injected in a circle of area given by 
variables injectionHeight and injectionRadius

Default radius is 1/sqrt(pi) which turns in an Area of 1 m2
Default height is 60 cm, i.e., slightly above the ground
(+10 cm as Geant4 reference system is set at the ground center, O).

2. DetectorList_WCD.xml

Intended to inject neutrons over a WCD of radius and height
given by tankRadius and tankHeight, respectively.
WCD is placed right on top of a ground of default dimensions 5x5x1 m3
Particles are injected over a circular area slightly above the WCD
given by injectionHeight and injectionRadius (double of default WCD radius).

																OUTPUT
===================================================================

Energy deposits at ground are stored in ASCII file GroundTrackingInfo.dat.

This information is stored in G4NeutronSteppingAction.

WCD signals are stored at default JSON file output.json given in the
configuration file.
