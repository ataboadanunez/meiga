Application created for the study of Michel Electrons (electrons from the decay of a muon) 
based on simulations on a Water-Cherenkov Detector.

This application is essentially the G4WCDSimulator with some modifications:

1. InjectionMode.
	InjectionMode = 0 (standard way). Particles are injected outside the detector (eg., secondary flux).
	InjectionMode = 1. Particles are injected inside the detectors (eg., sample of electrons)

2. Geometry.
	The geometry of the tank is chosen to be r=780 mm and h=1580 mm (Nahuelito, LAGO)

3. Actions.
	3.1. 

The outcome of this analysis will be presented at the RICH 22 conference.
