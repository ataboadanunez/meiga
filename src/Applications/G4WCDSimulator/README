Example Application to simulate a flux of secondary particles
on a Water-Cerenkov Detector. 

- DetectorList.xml:
Particles are injected over a circle of radius 1.5 m at a 
height of 2 m. Detector WCD centered at the origin.

- G4WCDSimulator.json:
* Input: using ARTI by default. injecting sample file in
   documentation.
* Output:
   CompressOutput = true,
   SaveInput = true,
   SavePETimeDistribution = false, if true, lists with the
   arrival times of the photo-electrons at the PMT will be
   stored (needed for pulse calculation).
   SaveEnergy = true (energy deposited per injected particle)
   SaveCharge = true (number of photo-electrons at PMT)

* Simulation:
   SimulationMode = eFast. Cerenkov photons are propagated
   only if they will reach PMT. Saves simulation time.
   If eFull, all Photons are propagated (with same results).
