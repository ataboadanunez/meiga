Application for simulating a muon telescope using Scintillator Planes.

The hodoscope consists of planes of scintillator bars, each with
N bars along the x-direction and N bars along the y-direction 
such that a grid of NxN pixels is formed.

An example isprovided in the detector with type `eHodoscope`,
which contains 12x12 scintillator bars with default geometry
values (see the DetetorConstruction in src/G4Models/Hodoscope.cc).

Fibers and one "pixel" acting as Optical Devices (PMT / SiPM) at the end
of the fiber are also implemented, giving the possibility of storing
Photo-electron time traces and Charge (only in Full Simulation mode).

Each bar is stored as a Sensitive Detector itself by means of the
G4MScintillatorBarAction class (in G4Models). 

The G4HodoscopeAction class computes the `index` of the hit bars along
each axis in a binary value. This information is then stored in the 
DetectorSimData class for each injected particle. The binary value 
reserves the first N bits to store hits of the bars along the X-axis
and the last N bits to store hits of the bars along the Y-axis.

For example, a binary value of `001000000000000100000000` means that the
impinging muon has hit the bar number "3" along the X-axis and the bar
number "4" along the Y-axis.

The DetectorList.xml provides an example with 3 eHodoscope detectors 
separated by 1 m each along the Z-axis. By default, particles are injected
in a circle of 0.5 m radius on top of the upper plane.
